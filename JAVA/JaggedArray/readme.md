# Implementation of Jagged array using ```JAVA```

### What is a Jagged Array?
A jagged array is basically **array of arrays**, which means elements of a particular array is an array in itself, and it can be of any size required. 
We can create a 2-D array but with a variable number of columns in each row.

The following image will help you understand better:

The following is the program statement which can be solved with the help of Jagged arrays : 


**Write a program which stores information about n players in a two dimensional
array. The array should contain number of rows equal to number of players. Each row
will have number of columns equal to number of matches played by that player which
may vary from player to player. The program should display player number (index +1),
runs scored in all matches and its batting average as output. (It is expected to assign
columns to each row dynamically after getting value from user.**
